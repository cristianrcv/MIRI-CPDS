From our point of view, this seminar was great to understand the basic functionality
of an asynchronous consensus algorithm, as PAXOS is. We were able to learn some more about 
Erlang and its graphical capabilites that resulted very useful in order to follow the protocol life
cycle. We have experienced how comfortable is Erlang when working with processes.

This assignment was done in a very simple scenario with 8 processes running. This helped
us understanding the algorithm on a first phase. However, once the key points were covered,
this scenario became trivial and we lacked of maybe a second phase with a deeper analysis.
For instance, seeing real-world implementations and how PAXOS is implemented in other programming 
languages, some use-cases and real-world scenarios would have resulted in a very attractive learning.
