** Comparison between Banket and BanketNoWait **

In the first approach (Banket) any thread that is waiting for the pot to be filled cannot execute any 
other action, whereas in the BanketNoWait implementation the threads can potentially execute other 
actions while waiting for the pot to be filled.

It can be stated that the Banket implementation blocks the threads until the resource is available and
the BanketNoWait implementation allows the threads to execute the actions that have free resources 
(but they will constantly pool for the resources status in order to try to execute their actions).

In this case, Savages can only eat (single action) so both approaches give us a similar result. However,
if the savages could perform more than one action the second approach would allow them to execute them 
when some resources are not available.
